# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-ANN
Heart disease prediction using a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) built with Keras. The dataset is preprocessed with standardization and splitting into training and testing sets. A classification model is trained using a softmax activation function and categorical crossentropy loss. Evaluation includes accuracy and prediction metrics.
